# Big O Algorithm Classification - O(g)

Time complexity: The number of computations used to process the input data
Space complexity: The amount of data used to process the input data

## O(1) - Constant
Number of computations independent of input data size
Amount of data used independent of input data size

## O(log(n)) - Logarithmic
Number of computations becomes nearly constant as input data size increases.
A binary search tree with 1,000,000 nodes only is only 20 levels deep.
With every parent to child step during tree traversal, the input data size halves.

## O(sqrt(n)) -

## O(n) - Linear
Number of computations directly proportional to input data size

## O(nlog(n)) - Linearithmic
Merge Sort
Quicksort

## O(n^2) - Quadratic
Code with double nested loops
Bubblesort

## O(n^k) - Polynomial
Code with more than one nested loop

## O(2^n) - Exponential

## O(n!) - Factorial
Permutations
