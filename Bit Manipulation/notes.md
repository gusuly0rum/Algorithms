# Bit Manipulation

representation of 1 using 3 bits is 001
representation of 2 using 3 bits is 010
representation of 3 using 3 bits is 011
001 XOR 010 is 011
001    ^    010 is 011
1 ^ 2 is 3

001 XOR 011 is 010
001    ^    011 is 010
1 ^ 2 is 3

representation of 1 using 2 bits is 01
representation of 2 using 2 bits is 10
representation of 3 using 2 bits is 11
01 XOR 11 is 10
01    ^    11 is 10
1 ^ 3 is 2

01 XOR 11 is 10
01    ^    11 is 10
1 ^ 3 is 2

The amount is bits used to represent numbers in a computer depends on the computer (32 bit, 64 bit is called word size)

[1,2,3] ^ [1,2]

01		1
10		2
___
11		3*
11		3
___
00		0*
10		1
___
10		1*
01		2
___
11		3

So the missing element is 3

Using this unique element finder using XOR only used 2 bits.
